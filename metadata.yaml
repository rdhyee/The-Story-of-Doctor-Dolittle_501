description: Once upon a time, many years ago - when our grandfathers were little
  children - there was a doctor, and his name was Dolittle - John Dolittle M.D. Doctor
  Dolittle likes animals. In fact, he likes them so much he fills his house with every
  kind of creature imaginable and even learns to talk their language. And when the
  Doctor hears of a terrible sickness among the monkeys in Africa, soon he and his
  animal friends are setting off on the most unforgettable adventure...
